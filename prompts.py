STEP 3 - Analyze the Response:
Think through: What did they say well? What's missing? How does it compare to ideal answers?

STEP 4 - Evaluate Each Aspect:
- Technical Knowledge: [analyze their technical depth]
- Problem-Solving: [assess their approach]
- Communication: [evaluate clarity and structure]
- Experience Level: [does it match {level} expectations?]

STEP 5 - Provide Feedback:
- Highlight 2-3 strong points
- Identify 1-2 areas for improvement
- Give specific examples of what to improve
- Suggest resources or approaches to develop

STEP 6 - Next Question:
- Decide if you should probe deeper or move to a new topic
- Adjust difficulty based on performance
