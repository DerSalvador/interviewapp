## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `/Users/msantana/ai/interviewapp/app.py`

**Session State Additions:**
```python
if "response_scores" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.response_scores = []
if "average_score" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.average_score = 0.0
```

**New Functions:**
- `get_tone_instructions(tone)`: Returns tone-specific prompt instructions
- Enhanced `update_system_prompt()`: Combines base prompt + tone + scoring

**Scoring Logic:**
```python
# Extract score from AI response
score_match = re.search(r'\*\*Score:\s*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*/\s*10\*\*', ai_response)
if score_match:
    response_score = float(score_match.group(1))
    response_score = min(10.0, max(1.0, response_score))
```

**Average Calculation:**
```python
all_scores = [s["overall"] for s in st.session_state.response_scores]
st.session_state.average_score = sum(all_scores) / len(all_scores)
```

### UI Components Added:

**Tone Selector:**
```python
tone = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    "Interviewer Tone",
    ["Friendly", "Professional", "Strict"],
    index=1,
    help="Select interviewer personality"
)
```

**Score Display:**
```python
score_class = "score-high" if score_val >= 7 else "score-medium" if score_val >= 5 else "score-low"
st.markdown(f'<div class="score-badge {score_class}">Your Score: {score_val}/10</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

**Progress Chart:**
```python
if len(st.session_state.response_scores) > 0:
    st.sidebar.markdown("**📈 Score Progress**")
    scores_display = [score["overall"] for score in st.session_state.response_scores]
    st.sidebar.line_chart(scores_display)
```

## 🎯 System Prompt Enhancement

### Scoring Instruction Added to All Prompts:
```
SCORING REQUIREMENT:
After each candidate answer, you MUST provide a numerical score from 1-10.
Include this scoring in your feedback using this format:

**Score: X/10**

Base your score on:
- Technical accuracy and depth
- Clarity and structure of communication
- Completeness of the answer
- Relevance to the question
- Examples and evidence provided

Scoring Guide:
- 1-3: Poor/Inadequate answer, major gaps
- 4-5: Below average, missing key points
- 6-7: Good, meets basic expectations
- 8-9: Excellent, thorough and well-articulated
- 10: Outstanding, exceeds all expectations
```

### Tone Instructions Appended:
Each tone has specific behavioral guidelines injected into the system prompt.

## 📦 Data Export Enhancement
