## Examples of Scored Interactions

### Friendly Tone Example:
**Question**: "What is your experience with React?"

**User Answer**: "I've worked with React for about 2 years, building component-based UIs and using hooks."

**AI Response**:
> That's a great foundation! 🎉 I love that you mentioned hooks - that shows you're keeping up with modern React practices. Your experience with component-based architecture is excellent!
> 
> To make your answer even stronger, you could mention specific projects or challenges you've solved. Maybe talk about state management (Redux, Context API) or performance optimization techniques you've used?
> 
> **Score: 7/10**
> 
> You're doing really well! Next question: Can you explain the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?

---

### Strict Tone Example:
**Question**: "What is your experience with React?"

**User Answer**: "I've worked with React for about 2 years."

**AI Response**:
> That's insufficient. You need to provide specific details about what you've built, which React features you've mastered, and what challenges you've overcome. Simply stating years of experience without substance doesn't demonstrate competency.
> 
> **Score: 3/10**
> 
> Try again with concrete examples, or move on. What specific React patterns have you implemented?
